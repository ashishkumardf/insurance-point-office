                  Marine Insurance is a type of insurance that{' '}

                    {' '}
                    covers cargo losses or damage caused to ships, cargo
                    vessels, terminals, and any transport in which goods are
                    transferred or acquired
                  </span>
                  between different points of origin and their final
                  destination.{' '}
                  <span className="fw-bold">
                    Providing protection against transport-related losses,
                  </span>{' '}
                  this voyage policy provides a haven for shipping companies and
                  couriers because it protects them from costly potential losses
                  while transporting goods by water.
                </p>
                <p className="mx-sm-5 mx-3 mt-5 content_para">
                  Despite following laws and safety regulations, transporters
                  canâ€™t control natural occurrences that might disrupt the cargo
                  or vessel.{' '}
                  <span className="fw-bold">
                    Things like weather hazards, encounters with pirates, and
                    cross border conflicts{' '}
                  </span>{' '}
                  are very common in water transportation and the damages
                  associated with these situations can cause a significant
                  financial hardship for ship owners. This is where a marine
                  insurance policy comes to the rescue, protecting the interests
                  of shipping corporations and transporters by providing them
                  with insurance coverage needed to defend against possible
                  losses.
                </p>
                <p className="mx-sm-5 mx-3 mt-5 content_para">
                  Another great feature of marine insurance is that{' '}
                  <span className="fw-bold">
                    transporters can choose coverage options applicable to their
                    specific trade.
                  </span>{' '}
                  Coverage requirements can differ, so shipping businesses can
                  choose an insurance plan that is customized. Different
                  policies are available to provide coverage according to the
                  size of the ship and routes taken.
