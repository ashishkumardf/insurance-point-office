                  meaning that a single premium is paid for all risks. This

                  owner or members of his/her family to other people. It may

                  Buying a house is the single largest investment for most
                  people. It is a herculean task that involves a lot of
                  planning, saving and research. However, the fact that you can
                  own a house without a home insurance policy makes us neglect
                  the concept of home insurance on the whole. Most of us feel
                  that it is a waste of money as it is a certain investment for
                  an uncertain cause. Nevertheless,{' '}

                    with the increase in natural calamities, it is a good idea
                    to take up a little expense to avoid a huge financial
                    setback in the future.

                      An extensive home insurance policy does not only protect
                      your building. It covers all the components in your
                      compound like your garage, shed, deck and even your fence.
                      Additionally, you can also opt for add-ons in your policy
                      and protect the contents of your house like your
                      furniture, electronics and valuable home appliances.

                      Natural disasters are every homeownerâ€™s nightmare. Taking
                      up the expense of repairing a damaged house is not the
                      kind of burden you want to put yourself. A detailed home
                      insurance plan covers you during natural calamities like
                      floods, landslides and earthquakes, for a minimal monthly
                      or yearly expense.

                      </span>
                      Though a home insurance policy might seem like an unwanted
                      expense, the benefits provided by the scheme are much more
                      than money can buy. Additionally, the most comprehensive
                      policy, which covers even the contents of the house, can
                      be bought at an approximate value of just Rs 5,000 per
                      year. At such nominal rates, getting your house insured is
                      not even an expensive affair.

                      Your home insurance will cover you during the unfortunate
                      incident of you accidentally damaging another property,
                      like in the case of a fire or mechanical damage.
                      Additionally, it will also cover the medical expenses of a
                      guest injured in your property.

                      Getting your home insured provides you with the ultimate

                      villa, once you have selected your policy and paid your
                      premium, protecting your property is no longer your
